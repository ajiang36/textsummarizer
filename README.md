# Text Summarizer

A python library that uses natural language processing to auto-summarize text files. 

### Background Context
I created this auto text summarizer in an attempt to combine my personal interests in both humanities and computer science. I was inspired by my history elective *HSS511: Silences and Gaps* on the Chinese students archives at Phillips Academy. I imagined a larger tool for the collection that could summarize the large amounts of text in the archives and then be able to classify them accordingly. 

### Intended Purpose

With more study into how to classify text using machine learning, I hope this library will be able to extract sentiment from and assign themes to text files as well. 

While the grander and more long-term goal is for this library to be able to support vast collections, it can still be used by students daily when assigned really long readings. Personally, after reading an article or text by skimming or thoroughly annotating, when reviewing the text it can be very helpful to have an abbreviated summary of it.

### Setup
All nltk corpus data needed should be downloaded with the existing code.
